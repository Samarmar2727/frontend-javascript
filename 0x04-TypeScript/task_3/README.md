## üìÅ Task 8: Ambient Namespaces

- Defined a `RowID` type (number) and `RowElement` interface with optional `age`.
- Created an ambient declaration file `crud.d.ts` for a JS module `crud.js`.
- Used the ambient declarations to:
  - Insert a row with first and last name.
  - Update the row by adding `age`.
  - Delete the row using its ID.
- All types imported from `interface.ts`.
